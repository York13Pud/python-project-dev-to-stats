# Dev.to Article Statistics Monitoring

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to gather all of the articles from your account and allow you to see the changes in the stats per article in one place, rather than by checking each individual article.

The items it tracks include:

* The number of likes per post
  * Changes per hour for each post
* The number of comments per post
  * Changes per hour for each post

Each article will be polled hourly to give a granular hourly change tracking although it can show the totals by day, week, month and year.

## Instructions

To be added later.

## Status

This project is currently on hold (24-02-2023). The reason is that a test instance has been deployed to collect data for the next two months so that there is a good sample size to work with in the next phase, which will be the visualisation of the data.
